# 🚀 Your Dependencies Just Became Superpowers

> **The moment you run `vibe init`, every dependency in your project transforms into an instantly-available tool across ALL your AI environments. Welcome to the future of development.**

## 🤯 The Revolutionary Idea

What if every library you `npm install` didn't just add code to your project, but **instantly unlocked new superpowers** for your AI assistant?

- Add **Hono**? Your AI now knows advanced routing patterns and can build APIs instantly
- Install **Zod**? Schema validation and type generation tools appear in every AI environment  
- Use **Effect-TS**? Async composition and error handling expertise becomes available everywhere

**This isn't a dream. This is `.vibe`.** 

## ⚡ Zero-Config Magic

```bash
# 1. One-time setup (installs daemon + CLI)
curl -fsSL https://vibe.sh/install.sh | sh

# 2. In any project, unlock the magic
vibe init
```

That's it. From this moment forward:

- 🧠 **Your AI gets smarter** with every dependency you add
- 🌐 **Works everywhere** - Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, any MCP-compatible AI
- 🔄 **Follows you** across machines, environments, and tools
- 📚 **Never forgets** your architectural decisions and patterns

## 🌟 The Vision: Network Effects at Scale

Imagine a world where:

- **Every project** with a `.vibe` folder shares its tool intelligence
- **Every developer** benefits from the collective wisdom of how libraries should be used
- **Every AI assistant** becomes exponentially smarter with each new project

This isn't just about making *your* development better. It's about creating an **open standard** that elevates the entire developer ecosystem, without requiring anyone to coordinate or adopt anything.
