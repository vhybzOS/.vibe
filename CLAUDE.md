# .vibe Project Instructions

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: READ AGENTS.md FIRST**

Before any work, you MUST:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` completely
2. Enter planning mode
3. Ask: "What user flow should we implement first?"
4. Follow the requirements gathering protocol
5. Never code without explicit approval of implementation plan

## **Project Context**

This is a local-first, autonomous AI development environment built with Effect-TS and functional programming principles. Quality and architectural consistency are paramount.

**Key Technologies**: Deno, Effect-TS, TypeScript, Zod, functional programming patterns

**Development Philosophy**: Test-driven, Effect-TS composition, tagged union errors, service-oriented architecture

## **Critical Technical Requirements - Effect-TS Patterns**

### **Correct Effect-TS Import Pattern (CRITICAL)**

Based on official Effect documentation, use this import pattern:

```typescript
import { Effect, pipe } from 'effect'

// âœ… Correct - Use Effect namespace for functions
const readFile = (path: string): Effect.Effect<string, FileSystemError> =>
  Effect.tryPromise({
    try: () => Deno.readTextFile(path),
    catch: (e) => createFileSystemError(e, path, 'Failed to read file'),
  })

// âœ… Correct - Composing with pipe
const processFile = (path: string) =>
  pipe(
    readFile(path),
    Effect.flatMap(parseContent),
    Effect.map(transformData),
    Effect.catchAll(handleError),
  )
```

### **Effect Function Usage**

- `Effect.succeed(value)` - Create successful effect
- `Effect.fail(error)` - Create failed effect
- `Effect.sync(() => {})` - Synchronous effect
- `Effect.tryPromise({ try, catch })` - Async effect with error handling
- `Effect.flatMap(effect, fn)` - Chain effects sequentially
- `Effect.map(effect, fn)` - Transform effect value
- `Effect.catchAll(effect, fn)` - Handle all errors
- `pipe(effect, ...)` - Compose effects functionally

## **Planning Mode Protocol**

Always start sessions in planning mode. Ask for specific user flow requirements. Present complete implementation plans before coding. Get explicit approval before any file changes.

## **Commit Protocol**

When instructed to commit:

1. **Always** run `deno task fmt` first
2. **Don't** follow pre-configured flow of checking past commits etc.
3. **Grab** as much useful descriptive info as you can from interactions since last commit
4. **Make the commit message engaging and fun** - start with conventional commit tag if applicable (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`), then emojis are good, corporate wording is boring, yet maximum information capture for highly technical (but cool) audience
5. **Craft** the best summary from recent work
6. **Execute** `git commit -m` in one shot with comprehensive message
