# Deno Vibe Coding Starter

A battle-tested "Operating System" for development projects, providing proven
workflows and protocols for building high-quality software with AI assistance.

## 🎯 What This Provides

This starter template gives you:

- **🧠 AGENTS.md** - Main entrypoint for any coding agent with clear development
  protocols
- **📋 PROTOCOLS.md** - Comprehensive workflow and coding standards reference
  manual
- **🚀 CLAUDE.md** - Simple setup for AI coding assistants
- **📊 PRD.md** - Product Requirements Document template for planning features
- **🧪 TESTS.md** - Test tracking and strategy documentation template

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone/Copy this starter** into your new project directory
2. **Update deno.json** with your project name and dependencies
3. **Customize AGENTS.md** with your project context (lines 13-20)
4. **Adapt PROTOCOLS.md** coding sections for your tech stack
5. **Initialize PRD.md** with your product vision and roadmap
6. **Start developing** using the proven workflow protocols

## 🏗️ How It Works

### Development Flow

1. **Read AGENTS.md** - Your main development entrypoint
2. **Follow protocols** - Reference PROTOCOLS.md for specific workflows
3. **Plan features** - Use PRD.md for product requirements
4. **Track testing** - Document test strategy in TESTS.md

### Key Features

- **Planning Mode Protocol** - Never code without clear requirements
- **8-Step Implementation Cycle** - Proven development workflow
- **Thread Management** - Handle complex multi-step work
- **Quality Gates** - Ensure production-ready code
- **Cross-References** - Easy navigation between protocols

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### For Your Tech Stack

1. **Update coding protocols** in PROTOCOLS.md sections:
   - Replace Deno-specific patterns with your runtime
   - Adapt testing frameworks and tools
   - Modify quality gate commands

### For Your Team

1. **Adapt workflow protocols** in PROTOCOLS.md:
   - Modify commit message templates
   - Adjust code review processes
   - Update deployment procedures

### For Your Product

1. **Initialize PRD.md** with:
   - Product vision and goals
   - Current roadmap and priorities
   - Feature specifications

## 📚 Core Protocols

- **[Planning Mode](PROTOCOLS.md#planning-mode-protocol)** - Start every session
  with clear requirements
- **[8-Step Cycle](PROTOCOLS.md#8-step-implementation-cycle)** - Test-driven
  development flow
- **[Thread Management](PROTOCOLS.md#thread-management-protocol)** - Handle
  complex implementations
- **[Quality Gates](PROTOCOLS.md#quality-gates)** - Production readiness
  standards

## 🎓 Philosophy

This "Operating System" embodies the **Vibe Coding** philosophy:

- **You are the architect** - Set the vision and quality standards
- **AI handles implementation** - Let agents do the detailed coding work
- **Protocols ensure quality** - Systematic workflows prevent chaos
- **Documentation drives development** - Requirements first, then code
