# What is .vibe?

> **TL;DR:** `.vibe` creates the missing standard for AI coding assistant configuration. Write rules once, they work everywhere. Your AI conversations become searchable architectural history, and your codebase becomes LLM-readable automatically.

Picture this: You're coding in Claude on your WSL2 setup, having deep architectural discussions about your TypeScript project. You push your changes and switch to your Windows machine to continue in Cursor. **Boom** ðŸ’¥ - your AI assistant has amnesia. All that context, all those decisions, all that shared understanding? Gone.

Every AI tool speaks its own language:

- Cursor wants `.cursorrules`
- Windsurf has `.windsurfrules`
- Claude Code uses `.claude/commands`
- GitHub Copilot needs `copilot-instructions.md`

It's like having a team where everyone speaks a different language and nobody takes notes. It's madness.

### The Big Idea: Universal AI Memory

What if there was a **single source of truth**? A universal brain that:

- âœ¨ Spoke every AI tool's language fluently?
- ðŸ§  Never forgot your architectural decisions?
- ðŸ”„ Followed you across every development environment?
- ðŸ“š Learned from your codebase and got smarter over time?
- ðŸ¤– Worked behind the scenes, invisibly, like a good assistant should?

That's **`.vibe`**. It's not another AI tool. It's the operating system that powers all of them, making them work better, together. It unifies your entire AI-assisted workflow into a single, cohesive, and intelligent system.
