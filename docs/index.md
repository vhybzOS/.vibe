# Your AI Assistant Just Got an Upgrade. It Doesn't Even Know It Yet.

Ever notice how your brilliant AI pair programmer gets amnesia the second you switch machines? Or how you have to teach every new tool the same set of rules for your project? It's madness.

**`.vibe` is the missing OS for AI-assisted development.** It's a single, autonomous engine that runs silently in the background, giving your AI a persistent memory, a deep understanding of your codebase, and a single source of truth for its rules.

No more config hell. No more repeating yourself. Just a smarter, more consistent AI partner, everywhere you code.

### Three Pillars of `.vibe`

*   ### ðŸŽ¯ **Universal Rules**
    Write rules once. `.vibe` makes them work everywhere. Your project's context is no longer trapped in a single tool.

*   ### ðŸ¤– **Autonomous Engine**
    The `.vibe` daemon watches your project, discovers new dependencies, and uses AI to generate coding rules for them automatically. You do nothing.

*   ### ðŸ§  **Persistent Memory**
    Your AI's context and architectural decisions follow you from your laptop to the cloud and back. It's like a photographic memory that syncs across dimensions.

## Get Started in 60 Seconds

Grab the latest release and run two commands. That's it.

```bash
# 1. Install the daemon and CLI (run this once)
curl -fsSL https://vibe.sh/install.sh | sh

# 2. In your project directory, initialize .vibe
vibe init
```

The moment you run `init`, the `.vibe` daemon starts analyzing your project and generating rules in the background.
